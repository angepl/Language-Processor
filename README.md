# Language-Processor
This is a Java project implementing a language processor for some basic functionalities of JavaScript programming language. The program receives a text file with the source code written in JavaScript and it gives as output all the tokens that were detected, all the grammar rules of the syntax grammar that were used (in the same order as they were used) and the symbol tables of global and local range. If any type of error (lexical, syntax or semantic) is detected through the process, an error message with some relative information is printed.
